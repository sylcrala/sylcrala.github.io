          <strong>The Cognitive Sandbox has been updated to v1.02</strong><br /> An issue with the persistence feature was fixed, ensuring by default the system loads the most recent past state. Our reflection methods were also updated to use more dynamic phrasing, and incorporate more agent traits in the process. <br/><a href = "https://github.com/sylcrala/cognitive_sandbox" target = "_blank">Check it out here!</a>
