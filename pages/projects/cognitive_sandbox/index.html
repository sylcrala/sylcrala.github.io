      <h1>The Cognitive Sandbox, a simulated, yet emergently unique, environment</h1>
      <img src = "https://github.com/sylcrala/cognitive_sandbox/blob/main/demos/demo.gif", alt = "Cognitive Sandbox Demo", width = "30%" />

      <br />
      <p> This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of the underlying particle engine created for the A.R.I.S. Project (and used in the Persitent Identity kit); inspired by projects like Conway's Game of Life and Lenia.</p>

      <p> 
        When you launch The Cognitive Sandbox, you'll be met with a visualizer containing (by default) 30 "agents"; miniature simulated entities all interacting with, and learning from, each other in a limited sense.
        
        These "agents", or more accurately, particles, are able to recognize when they're surrounded by other agents, as well as remember that information; and they recognize when they're not surrounded by anyone. They have reflective sequences that queue this information, as well as the surrounding particles.

        They're also able to generate their own language in a way - based off their internal "emotional rhythm"; one of their 6 positional dimensions.
      </p>

      <ul>
        Here is some interesting behavior I've noticed during development:
        <li>Dynamic clustering of positional location - sometimes into multiple groups</li>
        <ul><li>While they are slightly influenced to gather near each other (via average temporal positioning based on the total particle cluster); they haven't been taught to necessarily form various groups as they've portrayed.</li></ul>
        <li>Semantic clustering based on similar generated expressions</li>
        <ul><li>After integrating randomly-generated phrases into the reflective sequencing; memories started to "remember" according to who had similar generated phrases - potential subclustering based on emotional rhythm being demonstrated? (emotional rhythm is used in expression generation)</li></ul>
      </ul>
