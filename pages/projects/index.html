        <li><a href = "aris_project/index.html">The A.R.I.S. Project</a> - A local framework built off a custom physics engine designed to create an emergence-based identity, with reflective awareness, that persists across sessions; without ever having the need for offline fine-tuning. </li><br />
        <li><a href = "persistent_identity_kit/index.html">The Persistent Identity kit</a> - An extension kit for existing large-language models (LLMs) meant to establish reflective continuity across sessions; built off the underlying particle engine present in the A.R.I.S. Project.</li><br />
        <li><a href = "cognitive_sandbox/index.html">Cognitive Sandbox</a> - An environment dedicated for simulating basic "agents", as well as their interactions; built using a simplified version of the underlying particle engine from the A.R.I.S. Project.</li><br />
