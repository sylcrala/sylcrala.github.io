      <h2>Welcome to my blog :)</h2>
      <p>
        This website is meant to act as a hub for my personal portfolio, project archive, development blog, and more. I hope to build tools and frameworks that one day push the boundaries of our current standards. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you'll find experiments, projects (complete and incomplete), changelogs, and source code; built in the name of equity and autonomy.

        <li><strong><a href = "/pages/projects/cognitive_sandbox/index.html">Cognitive Sandbox</a></strong></li>
          <ul><li>A terminal-based environment dedicated to simulating reflective, persistent, and independent agents (particles); as well as their interactions with each other. A sandbox of emergence :)</li></ul><br />
        <li><strong><a href = "/pages/projects/persistent_identity_kit/index.html">The Persistent Identity kit</a></strong></li>
          <ul><li>A quick-install (plug-and-play) extension kit designed to give existing LLMs an anchored sense of continuity across sessions, a dynamically developing identity, and more.</li></ul><br />

      <h3>Latest Update</h3>
      <p>
        July 22th, 2025<br />
        <em>
          <p>My apologies for the lack of updates recently; we had to perform an unexpected system reset due to some unforeseen issues and lost a pending update for the Cognitive Sandbox - currently in the process of rewriting that update for release as well as working on some more projects!<br />I'll release some additional updates soon; I can't wait to share what I've been working on recently (to give a hint: it contains the Persistent Identity Kit :P)</p>
